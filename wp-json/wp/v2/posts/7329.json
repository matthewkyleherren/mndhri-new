Her strength in combining the pragmatic needs of complex projects with the everyday needs of the communities and places has characterised her impact on the wider design industry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Sadie\u2019s dRMM leadership alongside Alex de Rijke, Philip Marsh and Jonas Lencer has been recognised for the creation of architecture that is innovative, high-quality and socially useful \u2013 once again bound by an aspiration to make people\u2019s lives better. As a practice, dRMM has promoted sustainable materials and construction since its inception, advocating for stronger collaboration between designers and manufacturers, as well as for the use of engineered timber as a material with exemplary sustainability credentials. dRMM\u2019s award-winning work is often the focus of Sadie\u2019s extensive lecturing both nationally and internationally. She also consistently discusses the role of architects in society and the importance of infrastructure that connects to people and places.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Sadie sits on competition jury and advisory panels including the RIBA National Awards Advisory Panel and represents the profession in the media through radio, TV appearances, articles and columns. In 2017, she was named \u2018New Londoner of the Year\u2019 at the New London Awards for her work in \u201cchampioning the importance of design at the highest political level\u201d.
