<p><strong>If you fail to provide personal data</strong></p>
<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this direct marketing).</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out </strong></p>
<p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting our data privacy manager at <a href="mailto:mail@drmmstudio.com">mail@drmmstudio.com</a> or 020 7803 0777.</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these direct marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our cookies policy.</p>
<p><strong>Change of purpose </strong></p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact our data privacy manager.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose for which we originally collected it for, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>
<ul>
<li>External Third Parties including:
<ul>
<li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this website privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes without your explicit consent to do so at all times and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>The UK GDPR and DPA 2018 restricts data transfers to countries outside the UK in order to ensure that the level of data protection afforded to individuals by the UK GDPR and DPA 2018 is not undermined. You transfer Personal Data originating in one country across borders when you transmit, send, view or access that data in or to a different country</p>
<p>You may only transfer Personal Data outside the UK if one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>the Secretary of State has issued an adequacy regulation confirming that the country to which we transfer the Personal Data ensures an adequate level of protection for the Data Subjects&#8217; rights and freedoms; or</li>
<li>appropriate safeguards are in place such as binding corporate rules (BCR), standard contractual clauses approved by the Secretary of State, an approved code of conduct or a certification mechanism, a copy of which can be obtained from the Data Privacy Manager;</li>
<li>the Data Subject has provided Explicit Consent to the proposed transfer after being informed of any potential risks in limited circumstances and as a one off transfer; or</li>
<li>the transfer is necessary for one of the other reasons set out in the UK GDPR or DPA 2018 as an exemption, including the performance of a contract between us and the Data Subject, reasons of public interest, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving Consent and, in some limited cases, for our legitimate interest. You are referred to the ICO website at ico.org.uk to review the exemptions in respect of transferring data in this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact our data privacy manager if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>7. DATA SECURITY</strong><br />We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>8. DATA RETENTION</strong><br /><strong>How long will you use my information for?</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see &#8216;Request erasure&#8217; below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please refer to section 10. GLOSSARY  for more information about these rights.</p>
<p><strong>No fee usually required </strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data by making a subject access request (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What we may need from you </strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>Time limit to respond </strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>10. GLOSSARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lawful basis </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>&#8221; means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting our data protection manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Performance of Contract</strong>&#8221; means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong>&#8221; means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
<p><strong>Your legal rights</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a &#8220;data subject access request&#8221;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing </strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&#8217;s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
